# Production script archive

Specific versions of range model data scripts and parameter files used for production runs can be stored here. The run code for the main model run (not the missing species run) should be appended to name of the master shell script. Parameter files associated with the main run and subsequent (missing species) runs should also be saved with the run code appended.
